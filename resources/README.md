Vend_Ax.hex is a stage-1 loader file provided by Cypress.  It gets loaded into the chip's RAM and provides an interface which the host machine uses to program EEPROM.

Vend_Ax_Eeprom.hex, I'm not totally sure about.  It was in this repo when I forked it.  It might be a stage 1 loader for a chip other than FX2/FX2LP?
