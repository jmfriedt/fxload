fxload-libusb  
=============

Copyright (c) 2007 claudio.favi@epfl.ch

This code was modified from linux-hotplug project. 
http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/

Copying: read the copying coming with the code.

Usage is very similar to the original code expect that the device
selection/link/mode functions have been removed and replace with
interactive selection.

To load into RAM:
./fxload-libusb.exe -t fx2 -I ../fx2fw-sdcc/usbjtag.hex
To flash the EEPROM use the Vend_Ax.hex stage2 loader from Cypress.
./fxload-libusb.exe -s Vend_Ax.hex -c 0xC2 -t fx2 -I ../fx2fw-sdcc/usbjtag.hex

Dependencies: libusb: I used libusb-win32-filter-bin-0.1.12.0.exe . If
you use a different version and it does work. copy from libusb
installation tree the usb.h and libusb.a files. Then recompile.


Compilation: I use mingw32-gcc to create a standalone exe but you
could also use cygwin gcc.  Edit the makefile and then type: make
